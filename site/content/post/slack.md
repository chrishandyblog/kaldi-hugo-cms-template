Ok
Can we get back to having some decent forums online, or will we be reduced to hiding valuable information and knowledge behind non-crawl-able walls and making it harder to find?‬

Must be subject ourselves to answering the same questions over and over again in an IRC chat, or can we have an epic thread that stays updated with the latest info in a forum. 

Do we have to watch our veterans in the community leave because the conversation always reverts to basics? Or can we find a way to have community and value that people of various tenure find value in?

Can we for once lose the @everyone tag? We don't all need to know that you haven't looked at the pinned messages.

There has got to be a return to sanity.
